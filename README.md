# NYC-taxi-fare-prediction

In this challenge, hosted on Kaggle we are given a training set of 55M Taxi trips in New York in the train data and 9914 records in the test data. The goal of this challenge is to predict the fare of a taxi trip given information about the pickup and drop off locations, the pickup date time and number of passengers

Based on the features created using Exploratory Analysis, I understood how we can use the features identified using this exploratory analysis to create machine learning models and understand how to evaluate the models.

The workflow can be summarized as:

  Data Preparation and Feature engineering(60%)
  Creating a baseline prediction using linear regression(5%)
  Building Models without Feature Engineering(10%)
  Building Models with Feature Engineering(25%)
 
 Feature engineering significantly improved the predictive ability of our Machine Learning model and for further understanding, please read the report attached.
